##stacks are a linear collection of data that follow the first in last out rule
They are used in operating systems and programming languages for systematic memory arrangement.

##Tuples are a collection of ordered and immutable data enclosed in parenthesis.They use the First In Last Out rule.They are immutable and hence do not occupy
alot of memory and can also be used as keys in a dictionary.

##Queues are linear data structures that follow the First In First Out rule (FIFO) whereby, the first elemment to be put inside the queue is the first one to be removed.As the name suggest, queues work similar to real- life queues.
